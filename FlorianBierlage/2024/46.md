### What were your opinions on this week in total?

I had a difficult time this week. The weekend in particular. I found out that I had a chance to write the Thermo exam, so I wanted to finish the last homework. I didn't fully understand it but I think that's okay. I still have some time to learn for it. I need to work more on Biophysics and QFT. I feel like I've gotten faster at Guitar playing, however I am trying to practice playing with my last three fingers in particular. I have trouble sleeping, I hope I can fix it when I am back in Germany. I feel better after venting to my friends.
